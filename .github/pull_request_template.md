* All code changes should be accompanied with tests. If you are not
modifying any tests, just provide a short explanation of why updates
to tests are not necessary. In addition to helping catch bugs, tests
are extremely helpful in providing *context* that explains how your
changes can be used.

* Commit messages should explain *why* you made your change.
