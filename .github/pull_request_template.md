Thank you for submitting your pull request

Before pressing 'Create pull request' please read the checklist below.

* All code changes should be accompanied with tests. If you are not
modifying any tests, just provide a short explanation of why updates
to tests are not necessary. In addition to helping catch bugs, tests
are extremely helpful in providing _context_ that explains how your
changes can be used.

* Commit messages should explain _why_ you made the changes, not what
you changed.
