# git-TEST-commit-automation  [![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-2.59-blue.svg)](https://github.com/BradleyA/git-TEST-commit-automation/releases/tag/2.59)    [![GitHub commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/BradleyA/git-TEST-commit-automation/2.59.svg)](https://github.com/BradleyA/git-TEST-commit-automation/commits/)

**In development** ...(8/2019 - 9/2019)   **In test** ...............(9/7/2019 - )
 
**WARNING**: These instructions are incomplete. Consider them as notes quickly drafted on a napkin rather than proper documentation!

#### Strategy:
Scripts to assist running something, and checking something, then reporting something; when you commit something. 

#### About

git-TEST-commit-automation runs pre-commit and post-commit when "git commit -m 'message' " is executed. Pre-commit creates a file (${REPOSITORY_DIR}/hooks/COMMIT_FILE_LIST) which incluses files being commited. Post-commit searches in the same directory as the commited filename for a TEST/\<filename>/ directory. If found post-commit runs TEST/<filename>/SA-setup.sh and/or TEST/<filename>/FVT-setup.sh then searches for files beginning with SA- of FVT- and runs them.

#### Objectives:
1) Quick setup with default test cases for any Git repository (in seconds)
2) Quick uninstall on any Git repository (in seconds)
3) Quick check of test case depth for a file (option -f) and all files for any Git repository (option -a)
4) Quick setup of default SA- test cases for a file (git-TEST-cases.sh --filename sample.sh --add)
5) Quick upgrade of default test cases with test case code fixes (setup-git-TEST-cases.sh)
6) Quick reduction of untracked TEST case files (option -c)

#### Future Objectives 

- <COMMIT_FILE_NAME>.test-case-input - Add support   #12
- Design for quick test case git branch merge (include steps)
- Quick test case branch merge from test team's custom test cases without merge conflicts (include steps)
  - challenge is SA-setup.sh & FVT-setup.sh could be changed by development and test teams 
- Quick backup of all test cases in repository (\<FILE-NAME>.tar) (code is in uninstall-) (option: --backup --restore)
- Include support for custom test cases or intergration with other test or CI solutions 
- Support several types of files (support additional test case types (FVT,SA)

**Start editing from here:  These notes are cut and paste of information and make some since once I finsh design**
  
#### Types of Test Cases

**Funciotnal Verification (FVT)** is defined as the process of verifying that the design meets its specification from a functional perspective. ... Functional verification establishes that the design under test (DUT) implements the functionality of the specification correctly.

**Static Analysis (SA)** is the examination of code prior to the programâ€™s execution SA is code analysis, syntax, permission, code inspection, code review, etc.
	
Place the expected results from the test case into a file with the same test case name but add '.expected' ('dot'expected).  Pipe the output from the test case into a file with the same name but add '.test-case-output'. 

====>>>  Moved from above

    git commit -m 'latest changes' <COMMIT_FILE_NAME>

After entering the above command, Git runs any Git hooks found in \<REPOSITORY-NAME>/.git/hooks/ directory.  Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before and/or after events. Two local Git hooks are included with git-TEST-commit-automation. 

**pre-commit** - Creates \<REPOSITORY>/hooks/COMMIT_FILE_LIST with a list of \<REPOSITORY-PATH>/\<FILE> being committed.

**post-commit** 
- run test cases for files found in \<REPOSITORY>/hooks/COMMIT_FILE_LIST
- Loop through committed files found in COMMIT_FILE_LIST
- Check if COMMIT_FILE has a 'TEST' directory
- Create links to EXAMPLES/\<TEST_CASE> and \<TEST_CASE>.expected and other test case files (FVT-setup.sh, SA-setup.sh)
- Create list of test cases found in \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/ directory (files starting with SA-, FVT-)
- Loop through \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/SA-<TEST_CASE>
- Run \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/SA-<TEST_CASE>
- Loop through \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/FVT-<TEST_CASE>
    - Run \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/FVT-<TEST_CASE>

**git-TEST-cases.sh** - search from top of repository to list TEST directory test cases and manage test cases

**setup-git-TEST-cases.sh** - setup git TEST cases in current repository

**uninstall-git-TEST-cases.sh** - uninstall git TEST cases in current repository
  
**PASS** or **FAIL** or **ERROR**, some methed will notify someone of the results. (not sure which method is going to work for me and you? . . . stdout, logs-scrape, tables, email, twitter, slack, tall a friand, etc.)
 
**hooks directory**  The hooks directory was created because I wanted to modify the GitHub hooks and track changes per repository.  Include hooks/ in repostory because .git/hooks is not pushed and hooks change and these changes need to be tracked in a Git repository. (need to retest)

**Note**   I found out about hooks and need to remember and add to the README why I added a hooks directory in the repository so the hooks can be managed by the repository . . .Hooks are per-repository and are not designed to be pushed but can be pushed. Similarly, the repo config isn't pushed either, nor is anything in .git/info , or a number of other things. Pushing and pulling only exchanges branches/tags and commit objects (and anything reachable from a commit, e.g. trees, blobs** Add something about creating a symbolic link from ../.git/hooks to this hooks directory that are managed in this repository using markit.

#### System OS script tested
 * Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.38-v7+ armv7l)
 * Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-148-generic x86_64)

#### Design Principles
 * Have a simple setup process and a minimal learning curve
 * Be usable as non-root
 * Be easy to install and configure
