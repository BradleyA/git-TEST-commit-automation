**In test** ...............(9/7/2019 - )
 
**WARNING**: These instructions are incomplete. Consider them as notes quickly drafted on a napkin rather than proper documentation!

#### Strategy:
Scripts to assist running something, and checking something, then reporting something; when you commit something. 

#### Objectives:
1) Quick setup with default test cases for any Git repository (in seconds)
2) Quick uninstall on any Git repository (in seconds)
3) Quick check of test case depth for a file (option -f) and all files for any Git repository (option -a) (in seconds) 
4) Quick reduction of untracked TEST case files (option -c) (in seconds)
5) Quick upgrade of default test cases and test case code fixes (in seconds)
6) Quick setup and configuration of FVT and SA test cases in (in seconds)

#### Future Objectives 

- <COMMIT_FILE_NAME>.test-case-input - Add support   #12
- Design for quick test case git branch merge (include steps)
- Quick test branch merge from test team's custom test cases without merge conflicts (include steps)
  - challenge is SA-setup.sh & FVT-setup.sh could be changed by development and test teams 
- Quick backup of all test cases in repository (\<FILE-NAME>.tar) (code is currently in uninstall) (option: backup)
- Include support for custom test cases or intergration with other test or CI solutions 
- Support several types of files (support additional test case types (FVT,SA)

## Create Custom Test Cases

Create a test case in directory, TEST/<FILE_TO_BE_TESTED>/, in the same direcory of the <FILE_TO_BE_TESTED>.  There are two locations to place your custom test case.  For test cases designed only for one file, use TEST/<FILE_TO_BE_TESTED>/ directory.  For test cases designed to be shared for more than one files use hooks/EXAMPLES/ directory and add a link (ln) to it in TEST/<FILE_TO_BE_TESTED>/SA-setup.sh.  Currently SA-* and FVT-* test cases are the only test cases supported by post-commit.

When creating a custom test case name it 'SA-<test-case-name-no-dot-001>' for Static Analysis (SA) or 'FVT-<test-case-name-no-dot-001>' for Funciotnal Verification Test.  For example a Functional Verification Test that tests if the option '--help' works is named FVT-option-help-001).

**Funciotnal Verification (FVT)** is defined as the process of verifying that the design meets its specification from a functional perspective. ... Functional verification establishes that the design under test (DUT) implements the functionality of the specification correctly.

**Static Analysis (SA)** is the examination of code prior to the programâ€™s execution SA is code analysis, syntax, permission, code inspection, code review, etc.
	
Place the expected results from the test case into a file with the same test case name but add '.expected' ('dot'expected).  Pipe the output from the test case into a file with the same name but add '.test-case-output'. 

**Start editing from here:  These notes are cut and paste of information and make some since once I finsh design**

## Setup Test Cases ??

First do this then 

    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/git-TEST-commit-automation.git
 
 **execute setup-git-TEST-cases.sh in an existing Git repository already using git-TEST-commit-automation**
 
    cd ~/github/BradleyA/\<REPOSITORY>
    curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/BradleyA/git-TEST-commit-automation/tarball | tar -xzf - --wildcards BradleyA-git-TEST-commit-automation-*/hooks/bin/setup-git-TEST-cases.sh ; mv BradleyA-git-TEST-commit-automation-*/hooks/bin/setup-git-TEST-cases.sh . ; rm -r BradleyA-git-TEST-commit-automation-*/
    setup-git-TEST-cases.sh

    git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

            modified:   hooks/README.md

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

            hooks/EXAMPLES/FVT-exit-code-error-0-001
            hooks/EXAMPLES/FVT-exit-code-error-1-001
            hooks/EXAMPLES/tmp-test-tar-files/name-that-file-txt
            hooks/SETUP_TEST_CASES.md

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

## Do something else here


**setup an environment for all tests to be run, creating directories for output, setting environment variables ... include clean section to remove and unset environment variables**

Append the following lines into your test case:

# Memo:

    <COMMIT_FILE_NAME>.test-case-input - Add support
  
    <REPOSITORY>/<PATH>/TEST/<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/
      FVT-setup.sh  - setting up 'Production standard 10.0 TESTing' test cases
      SA-setup.sh  - setting up 'Production standard 10.0 TESTing' test cases
      FVT-cleanup.sh - remove all directories, files, links, ENVIRONMENT variables, <TEST_CASE_NAME>.test-case-output,etc for test cases
      SA-cleanup.sh - remove all directories, files, links, ENVIRONMENT variables, <TEST_CASE_NAME>.test-case-output, etc for test cases
      <TEST_CASE_NAME>.expected - expected output, error, etc
      <TEST_CASE_NAME>.test-case-output - output produced from test case
      <TEST_CASE_NAME>.test-case-input - input (. . text, directories, files, etc . . .)


#### Quick setup to test this solution
- fork or clone
- edit test script to test
- create TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/ directory
- copy hooks/EXAMPLES/SA-setup.sh TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/SA-setup.sh  

#### Setup for continued reuse

#### Steps for submitting additional test cases and code changes use pull requests

Note: 
edit  all SA-setup.sh:

    find ./hooks/ -type f -name SA-setup.sh -exec vi {} \;

Note:  

     $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	hooks/

Nothing added to commit after adding hooks but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

     $ ls -al
    total 32

     $ **mkdir -p TEST/dmonitor**
    
     $ cp hooks/EXAMPLES/SA-setup.sh TEST/dmonitor

====>>>  Moved from above

    git commit -m 'latest changes' <COMMIT_FILE_NAME>

After entering the above command, Git runs any Git hooks found in \<REPOSITORY-NAME>/.git/hooks/ directory.  Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before and/or after events. Two local Git hooks are included with git-TEST-commit-automation. 

- hooks/pre-commit  - Creates \<REPOSITORY>/hooks/COMMIT_FILE_LIST with a list of \<REPOSITORY-PATH>/\<FILE> being committed
- hooks/post-commit - Run production standard TESTing  

     **Production standard TESTing** - run test cases for files found in \<REPOSITORY>/hooks/COMMIT_FILE_LIST
  - Loop through committed files found in COMMIT_FILE_LIST
  - Check if COMMIT_FILE has a 'TEST' directory
  - Create links to EXAMPLES/\<TEST_CASE> and \<TEST_CASE>.expected and other test case files (FVT-setup.sh, SA-setup.sh)
  - Create list of test cases found in \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/ directory (files starting with SA-, FVT-)
  - Loop through \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/SA-<TEST_CASE>
    - Run \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/SA-<TEST_CASE>
  - Loop through \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/FVT-<TEST_CASE>
    - Run \<REPOSITORY>/\<PATH>/TEST/\<COMMIT_FILE_NAME>/FVT-<TEST_CASE>
  
**PASS** or **FAIL** or **ERROR**, some methed will notify someone of the results. (not sure which method is going to work for me and you? . . . stdout, logs-scrape, tables, email, twitter, slack, tall a friand, etc.)
 
**hooks directory**  The hooks directory was created because I wanted to modify the GitHub hooks and track changes per repository.  Include hooks/ in repostory because .git/hooks is not pushed and hooks change and these changes need to be tracked in a Git repository. (need to retest)
**Note**   I found out about hooks and need to remember and add to the README why I added a hooks directory in the repository so the hooks can be managed by the repository . . .Hooks are per-repository and are not designed to be pushed but can be pushed. Similarly, the repo config isn't pushed either, nor is anything in .git/info , or a number of other things. Pushing and pulling only exchanges branches/tags and commit objects (and anything reachable from a commit, e.g. trees, blobs** Add something about creating a symbolic link from ../.git/hooks to this hooks directory that are managed in this repository using markit.

[BradleyA/git-TEST-commit-automation] hooks/bin/setup-git-TEST-cases.sh - setup git TEST cases in current repository (#2)
after setup-git-TEST-cases.sh is run some additions steps are needed

git add hooks - if you want to include the tools in your repository remembering you can always upgrade to a later level without losing custom scripts or remove it

git add hooks
git commit -m 'install git-TEST-commit-automation'

You can turn a folder within a Git repository into a brand new repository.    **find that doc I printed to complete this section

add branch marge what ever
